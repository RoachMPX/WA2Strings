Remove function names (e.g. function NAME() to function())

EVENTS
------
Event type custom triggers are based on the assumption that they will be used with events
that pass relevant information. As such, the main way in which they differ from Status type
custom triggers is that they will not be forced to update at time when Status type custom
triggers would. Event type custom triggers can be set to hide on a timer, or they can have
a custom untrigger.

To use events that you specify in the Event(s) field you need to set up your functions in a
specific way. Say for example you wanted to check on events ENCOUNTER_START and ENCOUNTER_END
and you want to use these events in your trigger function:

--Event(s): ENCOUNTER_START, ENCOUNTER_END
--Trigger
function(event, arg1, arg2, ...)
    if event == "ENCOUNTER_START" then
        --Use the arguments for this event
        return true
    end
end

--Untrigger
function(event, arg1, arg2, ...)
    if event == "ENCOUNTER_END" then
        --Use the arguments for this event, or dont, just untrigger.
        return true
    end
end

The actual event is always passed into the function first, then all of its arguments.
Remember to check for the event first before assigning variable names to the argument
if you are using more than one event. You can use an ellipsis (...) to store arguments
in an event and use select() to pick out the ones you want and give differing variable
names to differing position of arguments. You can learn more about ellipsis in lua via
their documentation.
